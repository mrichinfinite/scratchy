# Regular print statement:
print("Hello World")

# Drawing a shape:
print("  /|")
print(" / |")
print("/__|")

# Using variables to print different things:
character_name = "Bill"
character_age = "63"
print("I have a friend named " + character_name + ", ")
print("and his age is " + character_age + ".")

# Variables in quotes are strings and you can change them to update the program in the middle of it:
character_name = "Jack"
character_age = "76"
print("I have a friend named " + character_name + ", ")
print("and his age is " + character_age + ".")

# Other types of variables like a number and a Boolean value:
character_age2 = 65
is_male = True

# This will print something out on a separate line:
print("This is \nfun")

# This will print a quotation mark:
print("Print a quotation mark in the middle of this string please\" Thanks")

# Use a string variable to print a statement:
phrase = "Good day"
print(phrase)

# Concatenate a string variable:
print(phrase + " mate")

# Use functions with strings; this makes the string variable lower case:
print(phrase.lower())

# This makes it upper case:
print(phrase.upper())

# This checks if it is written in all upper case and gives you back an answer in a Boolean format:
print(phrase.isupper())

# But now if we convert to upper case and then check again, we'll get a True value back:
print(phrase.upper().isupper())

# Figure out the length of the string by number of characters:
print(len(phrase))

# Specify the exact character in the string that you want to print:
print(phrase[0])
print(phrase[1])
print(phrase[2])
print(phrase[3])

# Use the index function to tell where a character is in a string variable (this is called "passing a parameter"):
print(phrase.index("G"))
print(phrase.index("o"))
print(phrase.index("d"))
print(phrase.index("a"))

''' Now I can also use the index function to see at what position a certain word in the string variable started. 
So, as we can see here, the word "day" started at ordinal number 5: '''
print(phrase.index("day"))

# You can replace words or letters in a string as well:
print(phrase.replace("Good", "Bad"))
print(phrase.replace("G", "H"))
# Google some more functions and play around with them, there are many out there!

# Let's work with some numbers and see what happens:
print(2)
print(2.0897)
print(-2.0897)
print(3 + 4.5)
print(3 * 4 + 5)
print(3 * (4 + 5))
print(20 / 5)
print(17 - 6)

# 10 divided by three with the remainder (this is called the modulus operator):
print(10 % 3)

my_num = 5
# This will print the number as a string:
print(str(my_num) + " is my favorite number")

# Absolute value of a number:
my_num = -5
print(abs(my_num))

# This function allows a number to be raised to the power of something:
print(pow(4, 6))

# Max returns the larger of the two numbers we pass into it:
print(max(4, 6))

# Can do the same with the smallest number:
print(min(4, 6))

# Can round a number as well:
print(round(2.5))
print(round(3.7))

''' Can import external code into our files using import 
(this will grab a few different math functions from the math module that we can use): '''
from math import *

# Floor method grabs the lowest number, or rounds down, if you will (in this case it will remove the decimal point):
print(floor(3.7))

# Ceil method does the exact opposite, it rounds up:
print(ceil(3.7))

# This will return the square root of a number:
print(sqrt(36))

# Get input from a user:
input("Enter your name: ")

# Now, let's store the input from our user into a variable:
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello " + name + "!")
age = input("Enter your age: ")
print("Hello " + name + "! You are " + age + ".")

# Time to build a calculator:
num1 = input("Enter a number: ")
num2 = input("Enter another number: ")
result = num1 + num2

We don't want that, we want to add things up. Let's fix it. Let's convert the strings to numbers: '''
num1 = input("Enter a number: ")
num2 = input("Enter another number: ")

# Now this will print an integer (a whole number):

print(result)

# But what about decimals? Let's try it:
num1 = input("Enter a number: ")

# Let's work with some lists. Let's put some friends in our lists array:
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim"]

#This will just print the list:
print(friends)

''' But let's try to print a specific element in the list using list indexing. 
Remember, in Python the first index value is 0..then 1, 2, 3 and so on. So, the 1st element in the list is index position 0: '''
print(friends[0])
print(friends[2])

''' You can also index starting from the end of the list instead of the beginning. 
This will immediately print the last element in the list (keep in mind it actually STARTS with -1, not 0!): '''
print(friends[-1])

# This will grab all of the elements in index position 1 and everything after that:
print(friends[1:])

# You can also specify a range. This will print all the names from Karen to Oscar:
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Oscar", "Toby"]
print(friends[1:4])

# Let's modify some elements. Let's change Karen to Mike by updating the 2nd element in our list, which corresponds to index value 1:
friends[1] = "Mike"
print(friends[1])

# You can put strings, numbers or Boolean values into a list:
friends = ["Kevin", 2, False]
print(friends)

# Extend a list to another list:
lucky_numbers = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Oscar", "Toby"]
friends.extend(lucky_numbers)
print(friends)

# Append another item onto the end of a list:
friends.append("Creed")
print(friends)

# Add another element anywhere in the list based on index value:
friends.insert(1, "Kelly")
print(friends)

# Remove an element in the list:
friends.remove("Jim")
print(friends)

# Remove all elements in the list:
friends.clear()
print(friends)

# Pop an item off of the end of the list:
friends = ["Kevin", "Karen", "Jim", "Oscar", "Toby"]
friends.pop()
print(friends)

# Check for a certain element, item or value in the list:
print(friends.index("Oscar"))
print(friends.index("Kevin"))
# If you put an element, item or value that isn't in the list, Python will throw an error.

# Count how many times the element, item or value appears in the list:

print(friends.count("Jim"))

# Sort the list in alphabetical order or in ascending order if it is numbers:

# Functions (code inside the function MUST be indented, outside indentation = outside of the function):
def say_hi():

# Now we have to call the function:
say_hi()

''' Let's look at how the flow goes using simple print statements, then the function. 
It will start at the first print statement, execute the code within the function, then end in the final print statement: '''
print("Top")

# Let's make the function a little bit more powerful by giving it some additional information called a parameter:
def say_hi(name):
    print("Hello " + name)

say_hi("Mike")
say_hi("Steve")

''' ^As you can see here, we can give the function a parameter, and based on what parameter we give it, 
it will perform its task a little bit differently. Let's try one more: '''
def say_hi(name, age):
    print("Hello " + name + ", you are " + str(age))

say_hi("Mike", 35)

''' You can pass in strings, integers, Booleans, arrays, etc. in functions. 
Generally, you will be breaking your code up into different functions as you go along. This is typical for Python. '''

''' Return statement to return information from a function. 
We are asking the program to give us some information back from this function, specifically we are asking it to cube the number 3. 
Let's cube the number and use our return statement: '''

you can refer to it by its key. '''

    "Oct": "October",
    "Nov": "November",
    "Dec": "December"
}

Keep in mind that each value is unique, so you cannot use the same value twice. '''
# There are two ways to print the keys here:
print(monthConversions["Nov"])
# or
print(monthConversions.get("Nov"))
# If you print a key that's not mappable to any values in the dictionary, you can actually pass in a default value if you'd like.
# You can also use numbers, etc. doesn't always have to be a string.

''' While loops! Structure in Python which allows us to loop through and execute a block of code multiple times. 
You can loop through a block of code in a while loop as long as a condition is true, if you want.

while i <= 10:
    print(i)

''' So what is happening here is we are printing out the while condition/declaration as long as it is true, the moment it becomes false, 
we print out statement here at the end. The code will keep executing from the top until the while declaration becomes false.
As you can see, we keep adding 1 to i until we get to the end, so this should print out a series of numbers from 1 to 10 
and the loop will stop iterating. '''

''' Now, before we move on, if I want to import this into another .py file I could say "from scratch import Student". 
First you define the .py file you are referencing then you refer to the Student class which resides inside of that file. 
We won't do that here since we are already in the scratch.py file, but you get the idea. Now, let's move on. '''
student1 = Student("Jim", "Business", 3.1, False)
