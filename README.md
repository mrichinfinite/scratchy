# scratchy
Python + Ruby basics

This repo is designed to provide basic lessons in Python and Ruby coding languages directly within the code structure itself.

You will find more comments than usual in the code because it is designed for learning.

All of the code will run successfully as is, but feel free to change it up and try new things as you go along!

All folders are contained within the folder called scratch.

The scratch1 folder contains a basic Python lesson with all the necessary .py files to run the code successfully.

The scratch2 folder contains additional Python lessons divided by subject. The .py files in this folder are meant to be run separately.

The scratch3 folder contains a basic Ruby lesson.

The scratch1 folder is complete, but the scratch2 and scratch3 folders are still a work in progress. Despite this, all the code in this repo will still run successfully.

The code lessons for the scratch1 and scratch3 folders are quite monolithic in nature (apologies, I will fix this at some point), but the code in scratch2 is more modular and is therefore easier to consume.

Stay tuned, more to come!
